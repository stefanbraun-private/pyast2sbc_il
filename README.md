pyast2sbc_il   
============   

*pyast2sbc_il* is written in Python 3 and will compile a minimal subset of the Python AST to SAIA(R) PCD Instruction List.   
It will be extremely restricted and it's currently work in progress.   
It should generate a minimal code skeleton as starting point for your next [Instruction List](https://www.sbc-support.com/en/services/getting-started/introduction/programming/instruction-list-programming/) project.   
   
   
*WARNING: This project is only my test and comes without any warranties.*   
   
*pyast2sbc_il* is loosely based on *[pyast64](https://github.com/benhoyt/pyast64)*. Special thanks to Ben Hoyt for his inspiring idea and good documentation on his website: http://benhoyt.com/writings/pyast64/
